
# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
Move the web app instance to a private subnet, and use a NAT gateway to talk to the ALB.



# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
Yes. It will at least provide unauthorized access from the public internet.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
No. As per AWS documentation, any unencrypted objects already in the bucket remain unencrypted.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
I do not understand the question, please elaborate what is meant by "this environment". From what I understand from the question, if the original cloud formation templates are applied
to the current environment, it would make our environment less secure again.
