The application instance allows SSH (port 22) traffic from any source from the public internet (0.0.0.0/0)
This is clearly a poor security practice because it allows anyone to try and attempt to connect to the instance
via SSH.

#2
One of the inbound rules also allows all ports traffic from all sources from the public internet.
This clearly defeats the purpose of having the other inbound rules.
Also the web service should forward requests to the web application instance which listens on port 5000 only
from the ALB and not from all sources (0.0.0.0/0)
